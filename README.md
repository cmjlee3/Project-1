In order to create this game I started off with a multi-div layout. From there I created a functioniusing jquery to 
    1. Randomly select one div out of them all to be characterized by a color
    2. Assign a random color by using Math.random
    3. Assign a random size by using Math.random
    4. Assigned the rest of the divs with a white background and no border to make them invisible

Difficulties:
    1. Because of the random assignment of sizes to dots, the divs they occupy slightly shift.
        -Pro: I kind of liked the unpredictability it added
        -Con: I’m sure there’s a way to fix it but I wasn’t able to figure it out
    2. I attempted to create a ‘Game Over’ feature by making it so after a certain amount of missed dot clicks the game would alert “Game Over” and reset.
        -Had difficulty targeting the area unspecific to the randomized dots.
